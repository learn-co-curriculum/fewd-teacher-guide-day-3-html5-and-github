## Objectives
* Provide students more tags to enrich their HTML vocab
* Introduce the process of saving their work and collaborating (GitHub+Remotes+Git behaviors to date)

### Key Student Take-Aways
* Students can use Learn to navigate courses
* Students use their “cloud computer” to develop “scratch” solutions as they learn
* Students see their implementations appear in the browser as rendered content by using the `httpserver` on their “cloud computer”

### Caveats

* Git Remotes and Github Codealong: They will need to use their cloud instance here.
* Learn IDE does not save nested clonings within the top level clone. This work will be throwaway and it’s fair to tell them this.
* Github Pull Requests: It might be great to facilitate this lesson in pairs. So that a student makes a PR against another student’s fork.
